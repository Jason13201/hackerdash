# Hacker _Dash_

Official hack for the Suns Out Hacks Out MLH Hackathon by Team Cheesy! ðŸ§€

### Inspiration

To commemorate the end of the MLH Summer League, we wanted to build something to help the hackers of the world, whether it be by helping them find hackathons, join a team or remind them to attend the mini-events during a hackathon. That's why we built HackerDash.

### What it does

HackerDash comprises of a website and a discord bot. On the website, a list of upcoming hackathons are displayed, with the MLH news right beside it. The discord bot is nonetheless nifty, as it too can show the same information with the !hackathons and !news commands. Apart from that, the bot can also help you find a team using !lft, where you enter your timezone and your skills. It can also remind you to attend mini-events during the hackathon (true story, we were so busy hacking we missed the !Light event haha).
